# Shooting Angle and Equal-Time Tilt

This repo demonstrates two elegant facts about maximizing a soccer shot angle and the associated **equal-time tilt** argument.

## Demos

- **Demo 1:** [Tangent circle animation](https://github.com/microprediction/shootingangle/blob/main/shot_angle_tangent_circle.gif)  
  Shows that the best shooting point along a vertical walk line is the tangency point of the unique circle through the posts tangent to that line.

- **Demo 2:** [Equal-time tilt (2D math check)](https://github.com/microprediction/shootingangle/blob/main/equal_time_slide_3d.gif)  
  Verifies numerically that there exists a tilt direction of the field for which pucks sliding to each post arrive simultaneously.
