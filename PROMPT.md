Problem:

  Your task is to walk from a point on the goal line outside the goal straight back towards the other end of the soccer field until the angle of your shot is maximized. 


Elegant solution:

  
  There is a unique circle that is tangent to your path and also passes through both goal posts. The tangent point must be the best choice (think about it)


Even more elegant fact:

  
  Tilt the field and assume no friction. Allow two objects to slide along straight rails towards each goal post, accelerating from a stationary start. They will hit at the same time. 


Task 1. 


  Create a beautiful animation in Python that demonstrates the solution (and a visual proof)


Task 2. 

  Verify the second physics fact
